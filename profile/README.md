## **Key Workflow**

1. Motov detects vehicles violating traffic laws in real time.
2. The selected images are processed through Motov's privacy protection technology and then sent to the app.
3. Taxi drivers review the accumulated data in the app when they're not driving and decide whether to report the violation.
4. The photo/video data, along with the location, time, and the taxi driver's decision, is sent to local authorities in Gyeongsangbuk-do or Pohang, leading to the reporting of the offending vehicles.
